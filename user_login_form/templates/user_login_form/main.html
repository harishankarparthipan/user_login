				<h2>How to Write a Blog?</h2>
				<p>One of the biggest secrets professional bloggers (myself included) don’t want you to know is that we
					don’t actually know everything. Truth be told, sometimes we don’t know anything about a topic before
					we
					sit down to write about it.</p>
				<h2>How to research and write a blog post?</h2>
				<p>
					Pro tip: you don't actually need a passport to write a travel marketing post.
					This doesn’t mean that all bloggers are insincere fakers. On the contrary, many bloggers’ natural
					curiosity is what makes them great at what they do. If you blog for a living, you have to be
					comfortable
					jumping from one topic to the next, even if you don’t know anything about it. What allows us to do
					this,
					and to write authoritatively about subject areas that are new to us, is knowing how to properly
					research
					a blog post.It almost goes without saying, but relying solely on Wikipedia as a primary source is
					almost always a
					bad idea. Yes, Wikipedia does have thousands of excellently researched articles, but it’s not
					infallible, and erroneous facts do make their way into articles without site editors noticing. Plus,
					every verifiable fact on the site is cited from links elsewhere on the web, so why cite the
					middleman?</p>

				<h2>How to research and write a blog post?</h2>
				<p>
					Lou Diamond Phillips was a total beast in ‘La Bamba.’

					If you’re relying on third-party information to write your blog post, choose authoritative sources.
					Official associations, government websites, heavily cited research papers, and preeminent industry
					experts are all good examples. Nobody is right all the time, though, so approach every source with a
					the
					practiced skepticism of a journalist and question everything until you’re positive your information
					is
					solid.</p>

				<h2>Fact Check</h2>
				<p>
					A few years ago, I edited a piece written by a colleague focusing on the highlights of a major
					technology conference. The writer, under a seriously tight deadline, had done a bang-up job of
					writing
					great copy in virtually no time, but he failed to properly check his facts. He cited an article from
					Forbes in which the writer claimed Steve Jobs was using PowerPoint on stage – something that never
					happened. It was lazy journalism on the part of the Forbes writer, and an easy mistake to make on my
					colleague’s part, but the result was the same; one poorly researched article directly impacted
					another
					because both writers failed to do their due diligence.</p>
